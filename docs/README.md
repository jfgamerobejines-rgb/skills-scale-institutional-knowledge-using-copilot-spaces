# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central knowledge base for OctoAcme’s project and program management processes. This hub provides actionable guides, templates, and standards for initiating, planning, executing, releasing, and continually improving projects at OctoAcme. All team members have equal access to processes, decisions, and rationale—reducing onboarding friction and enabling consistent, repeatable project execution.

OctoAcme follows an iterative, outcome-driven lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective. Projects start with a lightweight Project One‑pager to capture the problem, SMART objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline. Approved initiatives are broken into shippable increments with acceptance criteria and a documented Definition of Done; work is tracked on a project board and progressed through small, reviewable pull requests with CI and testing gates.

Workflows emphasize clear ownership and predictable handoffs. Product Managers (PdM) define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers (PM) coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria and manual checks when required; stakeholders provide inputs and approval. The PR workflow links issues to acceptance criteria, requires passing CI (unit/integration tests and security scans) and at least one reviewer approval before merging. Releases use checklists—staging smoke tests, release notes, rollback plans, and post-deploy verification—to reduce risk.

Communication and quality assurance are embedded in cadence and tooling: daily standups for blockers/progress, weekly delivery syncs and PM+PdM alignment, regular stakeholder updates, and a defined escalation path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor). QA combines automated tests, CI security scans, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA as needed. Retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents produce tracked action items that feed back into the backlog to drive continuous improvement.
